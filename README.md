## Face Detection Using OpenCV
## 📌 Overview
This repository presents a simple yet effective implementation of face detection using the OpenCV library. It utilizes Haar cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images, making it a foundational project in the field of computer vision and image processing.

## 🧠 Objective
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the working of classical face detection techniques using Python. This can serve as a learning base for more advanced computer vision tasks such as facial recognition, emotion detection, and real-time face tracking.

## ⚙️ Requirements
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the code:
opencv-python
numpy
matplotlib
You can install the above libraries using the following command:
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/aryanmandlik12/face-detection.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd face-detection
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
4. Open and execute face_detection.ipynb to view the output and results.

## 💡 Note: This project is intended to be run inside a Jupyter Notebook environment.
